## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **responsibly**. We take security seriously and aim to respond promptly.

### How to Report

1. **Preferred:** Use GitHub’s security advisory system.  
   - Go to the **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.  
   - Include:
     - Description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
     - Potential impact

2. **Alternative:** Email directly to: rogermodu@gmail.com  
   - Subject: `[Security] <brief description>`  
   - Attach proof-of-concept or reproduction steps if possible  

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps prevent exposing sensitive information before a fix is released.

---

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours of reporting  
- **Investigation & Updates:** Updates provided within 1 week  
- **Fix Release:** As soon as possible, depending on severity

---

### Severity Classification

- **Critical:** Exploitable vulnerability causing data loss, remote code execution, or system compromise  
- **High:** Vulnerability that can cause significant impact but requires user action  
- **Medium:** Vulnerability with moderate impact  
- **Low:** Minor issues or informational findings  

We prioritize fixes based on severity.

### Security Practices

- Keep dependencies updated (Dependabot recommended)  
- Use automated code scanning tools (e.g., GitHub CodeQL)  
- Secret scanning is enabled to prevent sensitive data leaks
